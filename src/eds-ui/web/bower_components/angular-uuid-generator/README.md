# angular-uuid

Angular-uuid is an AngularJS wrapper around the excellent [node-uuid](https://github.com/broofa/node-uuid/) library by Robert Kieffer. This library provides simple, fast generation of [RFC4122](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt) UUIDS.

Features:

* AngularJS service â€“ no global scope pollution
* Generate RFC4122 version 1 or version 4 UUIDs
* Registered as a [Bower](https://www.bower.io) [component](https://github.com/component/component/wiki/Components) ('ebosveld/angular-uuid').
* Cryptographically strong random # generation on supporting platforms

## Getting started

```
bower install --save angular-uuid
```
